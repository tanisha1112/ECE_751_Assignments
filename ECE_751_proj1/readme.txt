Kalman Filter simulation 
===========================

This project is based on a simulation of the Kalman filter. Using state vectors, a Kalman signal model estimates the state. An example of a roughly constant velocity model is used for benchmarking.

Two graphs are plotted with respect to the velocity and position of the motion body.

Files
-----

The repository contains the source code (ece_751_proj1.m) that contains the function kalman_filter. 

It also contains an output folder (output) that contains the output results of the Matlab file. 

Installation notes
--------------------

These files were developed and tested on R2022a. The products need to run all of the files are:

* MATLAB R2022a
